## Problem Statement

We as the trendsetters need a way to display all of our projects in a user friendly manner to advertise our services and attract customers. Not having a website to showcase our projects and generate business is the problem which needs to be solved.

As a company, we should have a website up and running that can effectively showcase all our projects to potential clients, as well as have a clean UI and a pleasing user experience to maximise sales and improve the trustworthiness of our company. As a consequence of not having a company website, many profits we could be making from our services could be going to waste without a company website.

The development of a portfolio website for our company would be the best solution to this problem. This is an important development as it will increase sales by making our projects easily accessible for viewing to attract more customers and make it easy for them to get in contact with us and work with them.

## Proposed Solution

### What are you trying to achieve?

We are trying to develop a portfolio website that will be able to present our companies skills to any individuals who are interested in our services or would like to gauge our companies skills. To do this, our website needs to be designed taking UX principles into account, and should implement various techniques that will make our website unique to our company. A theme will be used to help create our website as well as promote/identify the company's image. By taking all this into consideration we can design a well laid out website that follows up-to-date trends, but still has the uniqueness of our company and designers.

### What is your overarching theme?

For our website we are looking to implement a simple, neat style website that makes use of vibrant/light colours and implements well designed interactions that make the website feel more complete. We decided on this as portfolios are usually considered a means to formally introduce yourself to employers, so they usually have a neat layout. Since this portfolio relates to design, we wanted to add a more creative look to it and make it feel less “set-out”. We opted for vibrant/light colours because it is easier to read information, and it fits the general mood/style that our company wanted to convey (tubik, 2018).

### Include some market research on existing websites with similar themes

#### Awwwards

[https://www.awwwards.com/inspiration/superlist-about-the-team](https://www.awwwards.com/inspiration/superlist-about-the-team)
The website had elements we thought were useful and we liked how the content was laid out. Having a picture displayed next to the designer/creator currently chosen made the layout clean which was something we wanted to keep throughout our website.

#### Weltio

[https://weltio.com/](https://weltio.com/)
This website provides a beautiful way to display a loading screen, which is something that inspired us. The structure of the website isn’t conventional in the sense that everything is placed in a strict, rigid manner. There’s an element of surprise through the animations that happen as you go through the website, which provides a fun experience for the user. The section where scrolling down brings up a new “card” is a source of inspiration for showing our portfolios within our own website.

#### Dennis Snellenberg

[https://dennissnellenberg.com/contact](https://dennissnellenberg.com/contact)
This website had a clean simple layout that we thought was something we could consider using. The style of headings, font and opacity made the page look nice.

#### Charles Bruyerre

[https://itssharl.ee/](https://itssharl.ee/)
We liked the simplistic look of the website and felt it did its job of expressing the designer without having them use excessive amounts of text. The colours all worked well together and there were various interactions with links, movement etc. that added to the value of the website. We also liked the website’s layout and font choice.

### Iterations of designs

Below are the designs of our website:

## Project Outline

### What is the site structure and how does it integrate?

#### Home Page

We will include a small and simple introduction here that will explain what we do as a company. Links to our most important pages, such as our “work” page, will also be included and easily noticeable.

#### Work Page

On this page we will showcase all our projects, with each project listed in its own card. Each card will give basic information about the project, such as the project name and what service it falls under, i.e. animation, interface design etc.

Each card will also be a link to a dedicated page to that project.

#### Project Details Page

When a user clicks a project name it will direct them to that specific project’s page, which will have all the details about the project.

These details include:

- When the project was made
- Who made the project (designer)
- What category/service the project falls under
- A small explanation about the project
- Images of the project
- A way of accessing the project for individuals to view it.

#### About Page

We will introduce our company on this page. Some details that will be included here will be; our roles, when our company started, the goals and values of our company, etc.

After introducing the company, we will introduce each member of our team, by providing an image of each team member and their name.

#### Contact Page

- Email of company
- Email of each member
- Basic form for any queries
- Social media links

#### How does our site integrate?

When a user is visiting our website they will arrive on the home page which contains a noticeable link to our “work” page. However, on every page the user will have access to the navigation bar menu, where they can easily move between the different pages, by simply clicking a specific link on the navigation menu.

### What are the key features?

Our key features would ideally be the design of our website and the way we demonstrate our work. This will provide a design that will express the creativity and uniqueness of our company, that would help attract clients. This includes interactivity and user experience, as these things will engage with the user, while making our site more memorable, and keeping users loyal to our company.

## Timeline & Schedule

There is a very basic timeline for this project, the project will run for 2 months (28th August to the 28th October). There will be 2 major deadlines for the project as per the following:

- **30 September** - a working prototype that will represent 80% of the final project proposed in this document. All the main interactions and animations will be included in this prototype.
- **28 October** - The final design of the website to be completed by this date. A usability test of the final website will also be included along with feedback and a conclusion based on the usability test.

## Design & Illustrations

<img src="https://github.com/BenjaminOsmers/IMY320_trendsetters/blob/master/design_guide.png" width=200px height=150px>

### Colour Palette

When designing our website our choice for our colour palette was inspired by colour theory, to create a harmonious colour combination, and colour psychology, to influence individuals feelings, emotions, and behaviours.  This led us to deciding on a colour palette that uses blues and purples, as these colours are associated with calm, trust, competence, loyalty and creativity. These are emotions that we want our potential clients to feel when visiting our website, to earn their trust and show that we are reliable. (Corrigan 2022)

### Fonts

When choosing our website fonts we wanted something that symbolises our brand identity and our company’s tone. Thus, we went with the choice of ‘Poppins’ and ‘DM Sans’, which we felt gave off a modern and authoritative feel to our website, and together both these fonts complemented each other due to their varying widths, which all fit together with the rest of the website. (Galvan 2022)

### Animations

Some of the animations we will implement are a loading screen, hover effects, transitions, and scrolling animations. Not only will this attract attention to our website, but also guide the user when they are navigating through our website, keep them interested for a longer period, and create an emotional connection with users, which all together may push users to trust our company.

### Illustrations

Right now the illustrations on our prototype are placeholder images. However, we will create our own illustrations in the same style as the placeholders. This style seamlessly fits in with our whole website, and makes everything look effortless. As mentioned above, we want our website to give off a modern feel. Hence, this style helps contribute to that.

### Navigation

Since we wanted every page on our website to have a way to easily access the navigation menu, we felt going with a hamburger menu would be best, since it does not take a lot of space on the website and is easily accessible from any page. However, normal burger menus use a side panel to show all the website’s links, whereas our website’s navigation menu takes up the whole page when clicked. This was inspired by the navigation menu of  [https://itssharl.ee/](https://itssharl.ee/). It has a very creative and stylish feel to it, which is what we are trying to achieve on our website.

### Branding

In order to create a brand for our website, we tried to make choices that felt consistent.  Thus, we chose visuals, fonts, colours, and a layout that fit well together to create a brand for our website that users would be able to easily recognise.

### Interactivity

We want to express the company’s creativity and “out of the box” thinking, so we have decided to implement interactivity through unique actions that the user can do, through certain actions such as clicking and dragging. An example of this would be when the user wants to view the various projects, instead of scrolling through each one, they can click and drag away the current project to view the next one.
